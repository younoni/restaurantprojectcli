🍜 Restaurant Inheritance System

A C++ project demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through a restaurant management system.

The project creates different types of restaurants, including Mexican, Japanese, and Mexican-Japanese fusion restaurants. It also demonstrates restaurant menus, menu items, and different restaurant-specific features.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a restaurant system using C++ classes and inheritance.

The main.cpp file creates restaurant objects and tests their functionality, including displaying restaurant information, describing cuisines, adding menu items, and displaying menus.

✨ Features

🍴 Restaurant inheritance hierarchy
🇯🇵 Japanese restaurant class
🇲🇽 Mexican restaurant class
🌮 Mexican-Japanese fusion restaurant
🍱 Menu item management
💰 Menu items with prices
🪑 Japanese restaurant tatami seating option
📋 Restaurant information and menu display
🧩 Demonstration of object-oriented programming

🧬 Restaurant Types

🇯🇵 Japanese Restaurant

The Japanese restaurant supports a tatami seating option.

When tatami seating is available, the restaurant description includes that feature; otherwise, it simply describes the restaurant as serving traditional Japanese cuisine.

🍽️ Menu System

The program creates menu items with names and prices and adds them to different restaurants.

Example menu items used in the project include:

- Tacos — $8.99
- Enchiladas — $12.99
- Sushi Tacos — $15.99
- Wasabi Guacamole — $7.99
- Sushi Roll — $14.99
- Ramen — $11.99

These items are then displayed through the restaurants' menu systems.

🧪 Testing

The main.cpp file creates instances of the different restaurant classes and tests their functionality.

It tests:

- Creating restaurant objects
- Displaying restaurant information
- Describing restaurant cuisines
- Displaying fusion specialties
- Creating menu items
- Adding menu items to restaurants
- Displaying restaurant menus
